# Ideas Repo

All the notes on projects that I'm planning, working on, or thinking about.
(Well not *all* of them. Just the ones that I feel like publishing)

Mostly uploaded here, so I can reference them as context, when talking to
someone about some idea or project.
AND so I don't forget to actually source control them.

## Overview

See [[ideas]] for an overview of topics I am interested in.
Depending on how relevant an idea currently is, it will either be referenced
*directly* in [[ideas]], or be available under some topic-specific file.

Most of the notes will probably start out as subheading of some category,
but as the idea grows, it may be moved to its own file.

## Discussion

If you are interested in one of my ideas or would like me to elaborate on it,
feel free to open a [discussion], or reach out to me on some other way.

<!--
  TODO: Not totally happy with the wording below, but I guess it is fine for now ...
-->

Otherwise, if you find some idea I have listed here useful, or it inspired you
to something, feel free to implement/use it as you want!

Though when you do, I would appreciate a message with a link to the project.
(Or if my idea felt substantial for your project, attribution would be nice too ðŸ™‚)

## Technology

Currently I use [`marksman`] for intra-doc-links (for `completions` and `goto-definition`),
but I might change that in the future.

In terms of markdown style will try to follow [`commonmark`].

For reading and writing the notes I use [`neovim`].
As for rendering them to HTML, I *don't* actually do that in the moment.

whether [`CC-BY-SA-4.0`] is a good license for that *shrug*)
