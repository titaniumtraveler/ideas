# Ideas Repo

All the notes on projects that I'm planning, working on, or thinking about.
(Well not *all* of them. Just the ones that I feel like publishing)

Mostly uploaded here, so I can reference them as context, when talking to
someone about some idea or project.
AND so I don't forget to actually source control them.

## Overview

See [ideas.md](./ideas.md) for an overview of topics I am interested in.
Depending on how relevant an idea currently is, it will either be referenced
*directly* in [ideas.md](./ideas.md), or be available under some topic-specific file.

Most of the notes will probably start out as subheading of some category,
but as the idea grows, it may be moved to its own file.

## Discussion

If you are interested in one of my ideas or would like me to elaborate on it,
feel free to open a [discussion], or reach out to me on some other way.

<!--
  TODO: Not totally happy with the wording below, but I guess it is fine for now ...
-->

Otherwise, if you find some idea I have listed here useful, or it inspired you
to something, feel free to implement/use it as you want!

Though when you do, I would appreciate a message with a link to the project.
(Or if my idea felt substantial for your project, attribution would be nice too ðŸ™‚)

## Technology

Currently I use [`marksman`] for [`intra-doc-links`], which provides both
`completions` and `goto-definition` but I might switch to another markdown
indexer and/or link format in the future.

Sadly github doesn't support this style of links, which means they look broken
in the github rendering and don't actually link to the content.
Still better than having to manually write out the file links *every single
time*!

In terms of markdown style will try to follow [`commonmark`].

For reading and writing the notes I use [`neovim`].
As for rendering them to HTML, I *don't* actually do that in the moment, so
reading in an editor with [`marksman`] installed is likely to provide the best
reading experience.

I am licensing this repository under [`CC-BY-SA-4.0`], because it seemed the
most appropriate non-software license I found on [`choosealicense.com`].

Though I have no idea in how far copyright applies to a collection of random
notes and ideas and whether [`CC-BY-SA-4.0`] even is a good license for that
purpose *shrug*
